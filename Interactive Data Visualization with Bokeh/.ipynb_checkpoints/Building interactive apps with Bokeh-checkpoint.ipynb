    "## Let's get started with building an interactive Bokeh app. \n",
    "\n",
    "This typically begins with importing the curdoc, or \"current document\", function from bokeh.io. This current document will eventually hold all the plots, controls, and layouts that you create. Your job in this exercise is to use this function to add a single plot to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, Bryan described the process for running a Bokeh app using the bokeh serve command line tool. In this chapter and the one that follows, the DataCamp environment does this for you behind the scenes. Notice that your code is part of a script.py file. When you hit 'Submit Answer', you'll see in the IPython Shell that we call bokeh serve script.py for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, as in the previous chapters, that there are different options available for you to interact with your plots, and as before, you may have to scroll down to view the lower portion of the plots.\n",

    "#### Instructions\n",
    " - Import curdoc from bokeh.io and figure from bokeh.plotting.\n",
    " - Create a new plot called plot using the figure() function.\n",
    " - Add a line to the plot using [1,2,3,4,5] as the x coordinates and [2,5,4,6,7] as the y coordinates.\n",
    " - Add the plot to the current document using curdoc().add_root(). It needs to be passed in as an argument to add_root()."
